Fill a listView with information of employees obtained with an API


## How it works?
When you launch the app, it will fetch the data from the API and then save it into the phone, like that you don't always need 
an Internet connection to use the app.

  ### Theres 2 types of display!
   - A display with a listView
   - One with a recyclerView
  
  ### What else can I do?
   - Delete the saved data to free memory
   - Reload data (need an Internet connection)
   - Click on an element of the list to have another display
